2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell temp_i2c/Seg_reg[1]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) display/Seg_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell temp_i2c/Seg_reg[5]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) display/Seg_reg[0]/CLR, display/Seg_reg[3]/CLR, display/Seg_reg[4]/CLR,
display/Seg_reg[5]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell temp_i2c/Seg_reg[6]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) display/Seg_reg[2]/CLR, display/Seg_reg[6]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell temp_i2c/Seg_reg[7]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) display/Seg_reg[7]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
